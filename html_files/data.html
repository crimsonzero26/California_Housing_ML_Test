          <h1><strong><center>Session 0</center></strong></h1>
            <p><strong>March 2nd, 03/02/2023, 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM (Central)</strong></p>
            <p>You have decided that you will make purchase of an Airship, hire a crew for additional assistance, and travel to Hyrantam via Airship. With a full double movement of the vessel, and the checks provided by Paracelsus and Ree, your arrival will take approximately 5 days, as long as travel does not cease.</p>
            <p>I want you to also think about the logistics of landing in a flooded zone without a proper airship port at hand. It is a village, barely 300 people live there, and thus there are no facilities nearby for such a vessel.</p>
            <p>I have spoken to Mathew and he has agreed to allow Thasan to pay for the expense of the vessel and its needs. He has requested additional redesign of the airship for utilization against the Eye of Abendego and potential extraplanar travel so I will be working on that over the next 2 weeks. I may need to invent some subsystems for this to function, but I will figure it out.</p>
            <p>Also, keep in mind that during the next 2 weeks, Sean, Martin, and I will be experimenting with the Foundry VTT to see how we can utilize it into the game, and other campaigns. We will likely be using the VTT for at minimum enhanced combat awareness for encounters, but perhaps integrating most of what we do into it.</p>
            <p>Also, a reminder: we are not doing XP in this campaign. It is entirely by Milestones.</p>
              
          <h1><strong>Session 1</strong></h1>
    
            <p><strong>March 16th, 03/16/2023, 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM (Central)</strong></p>
            <p>The party consisting of Krom [Barbarian], Meraaen [Cleric], Paracelsus [Alchemist], Riervaoch [Psychic], and Thasan [Druid] all heard out the Pathfinder Society's request to investigate the Eye of Abendego as explained by Jorvier Stormforged.</p>
            <p>After hearing out Jorvir most of the party agreed to the Society's request with Riervaoch needed to confirm an agreement further with Venture-Captain Calisro Benarry, after being restored from her drunken state. Calisro would later have nightmares after interacting with the party for unknown reasons.</p>
            <p>Upon agreement to the request it was determined that a vessel would be constructed for the party in order to help them complete the Society's request. With Thasan providing the majority of the funding for the vessel he also provided desingn requests for the vessel, with some choices being rejected by the party.</p>
            <p>With the plans on hand Paracelsus led the construction of the vessel along with dozens of shipbuilders from the Pathfinder Society. After a week of nonstop construction the vessel's construction was completed and was named the Mystic Tides. Note: For more information on Mystic Tides and the crew, check out further details under the campaign dropdown menu.</p>
            <p>To help the main party in accomplishing their goal, more Society agents joined them to crew the Mystic Tides. These agents being Marina [female merfolk swashbuckler], Krag [male hobgoblin fighter], Squeak [female ratfolk rogue], Zahnradine [female gnome inventor], and Krog [ male orc expert].</p>
            <p>After completion of the Mystic Tides the party boarded and started their estimated 5 day air journey to the Sodden Lands coast nearest to the Eye of Abendego. Due to Fatigue from non-stop construction of Mystic Tides, Paracelsus piloted more slowly than planned which will extend the party's journey by half a day but otherwise was a calm first day of travel.</p>
            <p>On the second day the Mystic Tides was approached in the sky by a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=587">Quetz Couatl</a>. As captain of the Mystic Tides Riervaoch communicated with the serpentine celestial using celestial language. Riervaoch found out that the serpentine creature meant no harm to the party and is named Teoyocoatl</p>
            <p>Riervaoch and Teoyocoatl came to an agreement and is now aboard the Mystic Tides for an unspecified amout of time.</p>

          <h1><strong>Session 2</strong></h1>
    
            <p><strong>March 30th, 03/30/2023, 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM (Central)</strong></p>
            <p>We will begin the evening on the third day of the flying journey, aboard the Mystic Tides, towards the Sodden Lands coast near the Eye of Abendego and we will be adding a new player to the party.</p>
