          <h1><strong><center>Session 0</center></strong></h1>
            <p><strong>March 2nd, 03/02/2023, 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM (Central)</strong></p>
            <p>You have decided that you will make purchase of an Airship, hire a crew for additional assistance, and travel to Hyrantam via Airship. With a full double movement of the vessel, and the checks provided by Paracelsus and Ree, your arrival will take approximately 5 days, as long as travel does not cease.</p>
            <p>I want you to also think about the logistics of landing in a flooded zone without a proper airship port at hand. It is a village, barely 300 people live there, and thus there are no facilities nearby for such a vessel.</p>
            <p>I have spoken to Mathew and he has agreed to allow Thasan to pay for the expense of the vessel and its needs. He has requested additional redesign of the airship for utilization against the Eye of Abendego and potential extraplanar travel so I will be working on that over the next 2 weeks. I may need to invent some subsystems for this to function, but I will figure it out.</p>
            <p>Also, keep in mind that during the next 2 weeks, Sean, Martin, and I will be experimenting with the Foundry VTT to see how we can utilize it into the game, and other campaigns. We will likely be using the VTT for at minimum enhanced combat awareness for encounters, but perhaps integrating most of what we do into it.</p>
            <p>Also, a reminder: we are not doing XP in this campaign. It is entirely by Milestones.</p>
              
          <h1><strong>Session 1</strong></h1>
    
            <p><strong>March 16th, 03/16/2023, 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM (Central)</strong></p>
            <p>The party consisting of Krom [Barbarian], Meraaen [Cleric], Paracelsus [Alchemist], Riervaoch [Psychic], and Thasan [Druid] all heard out the Pathfinder Society's request to investigate the Eye of Abendego as explained by Jorvier Stormforged.</p>
            <p>After hearing out Jorvir most of the party agreed to the Society's request with Riervaoch needed to confirm an agreement further with Venture-Captain Calisro Benarry, after being restored from her drunken state. Calisro would later have nightmares after interacting with the party for unknown reasons.</p>
            <p>Upon agreement to the request it was determined that a vessel would be constructed for the party in order to help them complete the Society's request. With Thasan providing the majority of the funding for the vessel he also provided desingn requests for the vessel, with some choices being rejected by the party.</p>
            <p>With the plans on hand Paracelsus led the construction of the vessel along with dozens of shipbuilders from the Pathfinder Society. After a week of nonstop construction the vessel's construction was completed and was named the Mystic Tides. Note: For more information on Mystic Tides and the crew, check out further details under the campaign dropdown menu.</p>
            <p>To help the main party in accomplishing their goal, more Society agents joined them to crew the Mystic Tides. These agents being Marina [female merfolk swashbuckler], Krag [male hobgoblin fighter], Squeak [female ratfolk rogue], Zahnradine [female gnome inventor], and Krog [ male orc expert].</p>
            <p>After completion of the Mystic Tides the party boarded and started their estimated 5 day air journey to the Sodden Lands coast nearest to the Eye of Abendego. Due to Fatigue from non-stop construction of Mystic Tides, Paracelsus piloted more slowly than planned which will extend the party's journey by half a day but otherwise was a calm first day of travel.</p>
            <p>On the second day the Mystic Tides was approached in the sky by a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=587">Quetz Couatl</a>. As captain of the Mystic Tides Riervaoch communicated with the serpentine celestial using celestial language. Riervaoch found out that the serpentine creature meant no harm to the party and is named Teoyocoatl</p>
            <p>Riervaoch and Teoyocoatl came to an agreement and is now aboard the Mystic Tides for an unspecified amout of time.</p>
            <p id="demo"></p>
          
          <h1><strong>Session 2</strong></h1>
    
            <p><strong>March 30th, 03/30/2023, 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM (Central)</strong></p>
            <p>Resuming from last session and still on the second day Thasan has used Aura sight and Nature based knowledge on Teoyocoatl to determine that it's an ancient very powerful Lawful Good creature that is not extra planar and currently friendly towards the group at the moment. As well that Teoyocoatl is not inherently different from a Querzcoatl, it is unique in its feather colors and patterns, reflecting its individuality.</p>
            <p>On the third Thasan received a feather from Teoyocoatl directly when he asked if it could share part of itself to help him teach his students back from the school he teaches from. Ree also conversed with Teoyocoatl telepathically learning that it has been sent from the heavens to mentor and go alongwith  a young dwarven woman in the southern lands of the Mwangi Expanse and help her along her path.</p>
            <p>Teoyocoatl also said "Look south, to a land like a hook, where the sea and the jungles meet. You will find a great place, where upon many spiders exist in harmony" when Ree requested help has to where she can find her tribe as she no longer remembers any of it. That night Ree ordered Jeweled Rice from Paracelsus to cook for her. On that day a thick cloud cover and a large stormfront began to build up towards the edge of The Barrier Wall Mountains.</p>
            <p>On the fourth day of the journey, due to a continuing and heavily bulding storm from the previous day, a strong headwind caused Paracelsus difficulty in maintaining control of the Mystic Tides and the air ship was forced to go lower closer to The Barrier Mountains. Being closer Paracelsus took notice of a large dust cloud off in the distance hovering over one of the mountain peaks being a few hundred feet in size.</p>
            <p>Paracelsus then informed and pointed out to the captain, Ree, of the dust cloud above the mountain peak. As the Mystic Tides approached closer Ree determined the dust cloud was not natural and requested Thasan's opinion on if they may be danger on approching. Thasan came up with some possibilities, most provable involving a giant, but ultimately recommended to go around it if possible. Ree seeking further information goes to the front of the air ship and uses <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=3666">Thoughtform Summoning </a>to summon a Giant Eagle.</p>
            <p>Ree commands the Giant Eagle to scout ahead and report back what it finds out about the cause of the dust cloud. The Giant Eagle reports that an insanely fast Fox standing on its hind legs is circling a Possibly mutated Hill Giant and is continuously attacking it. Once Ree relays that information to the rest Thasan, after given permission, embarks towards the site of the battle using <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=481">Wild Shape </a>to shapeshift into a red dragon. Krom also follows behind with the use of his <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2216">Soaring Wings </a>Magical Tattoo.</p>
            <p>As both Thasan and Krom get near the battle site for a brief second they see an orange and red streak fox with six tails and a white face full of anger right before it dashes towards the Giant chest and flicks it off into the distance flying like a sack of feathers colliding with a tree that shatters into millions of pieces and continuing to fly until it collided with the mountain causing a cacophony of noise with thousands pieces of rock flying in every direction. Upon landing Thasan shifts back to normal form and is able to identify the humaiod fox as a Kitsune.</p>
            <p>The Kitsune attempts to brush Thasan off and continue forwards when Ree receives a telephatic message from Captain Calisro about another Pathfinder Agent that will be in their travel path with her own personal mission and to not mess with her. At this time Krom lands next to Thasan, then once the Mystic Tides arrives Ree, with Meraaen in her hands, jumps down with a pair of bat wings to slowly fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>Ree approches the unknown Kitsune while holding out a wayfinder in her hand asking if she knows what this is. The kitsune identifies herself as Nirota and asks who the group is. Once Ree explains to Nirota who they are and their current mission and destination everyone boards the Mystic Tides including Nirota now having joined the group on their mission. On the fifth day the Mystic Tides makes it into the Sodden lands territory with the smell of sea water already in the air, otherwise it was a nice peacuful calm day of travel.</p>
            <p>On the sixth day of travel all remains calm while traveling half a day to arrive at their destination, the city of Hyrantam. The Mystic Tides successfully goes from air travel back to sea travel and then docks in Hyrantam.</p>
            <p id="demo"></p>
          
          <h1><strong>Session 3</strong></h1>
    
            <p><strong>April 13th, 04/13/2023, 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM (Central)</strong></p>
            <p>Upon arriving and docking at Hyrantam a man approches the Mystic Tides welcoming the group. The man identifies himself as Vancen and serves as the Harbormaster of Hyrantam. Vancen guides the party to his place of residence where he explains that the town is under siege by a small group of of powerful seers called Stormreaders that are allied with a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=825">Thunderbird </a>. The Stormreaders are forcing the townsfolk to scour the dangerous flooded reaches of the town for old Lirgeni relics and treasures as tributes. Furthermore they also demand to have dreamers with strange dreams of the town, before the age of lost omens, to be offered up to them. While the town has attempted to hide them the Stormreaders see through their deception and had the Thunderbird attack the town killing dozens after their first refusal. Since then a few selfless townsfolk have given themselves up to the Stormreaders for the good of the people. Because of the predators, now agitated from the constant storms, it has burden the town with difficulty in feeding and caring for themselves let alone look for treasures that the Stormreaders demand as tribute.</p>
            <p>To make matters worse, the local cleric has been kidnapped by a tribe of <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=3">Skum</a> and have not been able to rescue her given they are located at the Saoc Planetarium that is mostly underwater with some above water entrances but is not reachable for any local soldiers or citizens of the town.</p>
            <p>Through deeper discussions with Vancen, the party finds out that the only Stormrider he has met is a Garundi woman named Orleva and has <a href="https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Kerakinsi">Kerakinsis</a> with her every time, that the Thunderbird may not be here on its own volition, that there may still be treasure to offer the Stormriders in Aphelion Manor, and that the next tribute is due in a couple of days maybe 4 days at most.</p>
            <p>Regarding information that may aid the party in their investigation regarding the Eye of Abendego, Vancen informs and reassures the party, after Thasan attempted to bribe him thinking he was withholding information, that no one in town has information on the Eye of Avendego other that no one survives going there. He does share with us rumors that there is an old library nearby, possibly located in the ruins of the original city, that has survived somehow through the last few hundred years and perhaps may still contain secrets. Vancen also warns us that anyone who has attempted to approach the location realize that there are some magical barriers in place and believe it was created by the Lirgeni in the past and have therefore deemed it a dangerous location.</p>
            <p>Then from boredom Krom heads outside intending to take care of some of the sea monsters that have burden the town. While Krom jumps into the water searching for a fight the rest watch him other than Paracelsus who took out his fishing tackle and started fishing. Soon after Krom gets the attention of a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=820">Giant Squid</a> and begins to play with to make a show of it to the townspeople before he mercilessly stikes it down. Thasan enthusiastically jumps in to the water next. After 10 minutes of waiting, while everyone in town is scaveging the giant squid's remains and Paracelsus serves fish sticks from the fish he has caught, a gigantic dark green and blue <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=200">Elemental Tsunami</a> rises up through Thasan, picks him up and slams him on the surface of the ocean. In battle while it seems that Thasan's attack aren't doing much damage, while he is beaten up, a storm appears in the sky that has the clouds themselves turning blue, peuple, red, and orange until a gigantic thunderstrike comes out of the sky causing a deafening sounds that shatters windows and striking the elemental that evaporates in defeat but leaving Thasan with over 92% of his health gone. Once Thasan is back on the harbor he receives a Basic Meal from Paracelsus to help him recover some health.</p>
            <p id="demo"></p>
         
         <h1><strong>Session 4</strong></h1>
    
            <p><strong>April 20th, 04/20/2023, 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM (Central)</strong></p>
            <p>After the little fun the party had Ree has the party head back to the Mystic Tides to plan what to do next. After some deliberation the party decides to head to the Soac Planeterium first. In order to have the party approach the planetarium undected they will not use the Mystic Tides in the air to head there and then use Paracelsus' <a href="o	https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1370">Greater Folding Boat</a> item in his possesion. While most of the party has means to breath underwater Krom does not, without asking for permission Paracelsus takes out an <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=779">Alchemical Atomizer</a> filled with a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=99"> Greater Sea Touch Elixir</a> and sprays Krom with it to give him a means to breath underwater for the next 24 hours. With all preparations made the group heads to the an area about 100 feet from the planetarium in the air with the Mystic Tides and after leaving Marina in charge of the Mystic Tides to keep it flying and on stanby the party all jump down, in their own ways, into the water. Once the whole group is in the water Paracelsus speaks the command word to activate the Floatin Boat and change into a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Vehicles.aspx?ID=41">Cutter</a> that is piloted and crewed by <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1652">Etheral Sailors</a>and once all aboard the party heads towards the planetarium.</p>
            <p>Once the party had approached the planetarium, Ree activated her <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=3676">Thoughtsense</a> and used a focus to double it's range in order to check for the number of thinking creatures around 60 feet of her. Ree was able to detect at least 12 thinking creatures within the planetarium, she relayed this to the party before they made their way inside. The party got out of the cutter and changed it back to a small box as they headed underwater to find a way into the planetarium. Once they had found a door they had discussed how to in, when Krom heard the words "were going in" he had abrubtly kicked the door open. Inside they found a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1239">Tylosaurus</a> roaming inside the room. The Tylosaurus came rushing towards the party with the intent of eating them. Paraselsus allowed himself to be swallowed whole by the Tylosaurus which after about 10 seconds, due to the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=656">Green Gut</a> poison Paracelsus had on him, the creature vomited out Paracelsus and immediately bursted into dozens of pieces as a strange bubbling acidic poison like gas rapidly expanded throughout it's body and exploded in a beatuful array of death, gore, and blood. This caused the whole party to be covered in a layer of goo and guts on their person. Thasan casts <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=229">Prestidigitation</a> to help clean everyone while calling them "whiner babies" due to Ree's reaction to having her brand new clothes covered in guts, but only after he collected specimens and samples of the Tylosaurus. Due to all the commotion, multiple Skum came through the ceiling prepared to attack the party but were easily disposed of without too much effort from the party. The party progressed through the planetarium with Krom easily taking down any more Skum that were in their path.</p>
